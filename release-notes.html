<h1>CUBRID PHP Library release notes</h1> 
<hr> 
<h2>2008 R3.1 Release </h2> 

<pre class = "s1">
This release is a major release. CUBRID 3.1 Stable has been released. Several new features have been added to this version
including new BLOB and CLOB data types and new APIs in JDBC/CCI which can get foreign key information. Accordingly new 
functions and features are added in this CUBRID PHP version, and some bugs have been fixed.
</pre>

</table>

<h4>Functionality removed:</h4>

<pre class = "s1">
Glo data type has been removed from CUBRID 3.1, BLOB/CLOB can be used to replace it.
</pre>

<table border="1" cellpadding="5">
<tr>
  <th width="200" align="left">Glo related functions</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td width="200" align="left" valign="top">cubrid_new_glo<br>cubrid_save_to_glo<br>cubrid_load_from_glo<br>cubrid_send_glo</td>
</tr>
</table>

<h4>Changed and Enhanced Features:</h4>

<pre class = "s1">
1.) Add three new schema type integer constants for cubrid_schema(): 

    CUBRID_SCH_IMPORTED_KEYS
    CUBRID_SCH_EXPORTED_KEYS
    CUBRID_SCH_CROSS_REFERENCE

    They can be used to get foreign key information. 

2.) cubrid_bind support BLOB and CLOB data types.

3.) cubrid_unbuffered_query now is worthy of its name. It won't need to wait for that all query results have been complete. It will return 
    when the results are being generated, so you can't use cubrid_num_rows() and cubrid_data_seek() on a result set returned from 
    cubrid_unbuffered_query().

4.) cubrid_fetch_object: Add new parameters class_name and params, which can pass the name of class to instantiate and the constructor 
    for class_name objects.

5.) When cubrid_schema() fails, return false instead of -1.
6.) When cubrid_col_size() fails, return false instead of -1.
</pre>

<h4>Fixed bugs:</h4> 

<pre class = "s1">
1.) last db connetion/request resource management: If there is no variable to refer these resources, they will be removed by garbage collector.
2.) cubrid_execute: If cubrid fails to get result info after executing sql statement, there may be memory leak.
3.) cubrid_disconnect: When disconnecting any db connection, it will always reset the last request and connection info.
4.) cubrid_unbuffered_query: When query execution fails, it don't free the allocated request resource.
