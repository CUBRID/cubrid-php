<h1>CUBRID PHP Library release notes</h1> 
<hr> 
<h2>2008 R4.1 Release </h2> 

<pre class = "s1">
This release is a major release. Several new features have been added to this version including persistent connecting,
query timeout and so on. Accordingly new functions are added, and several bugs have been fixed.
</pre>

<h4>Functionality added:</h4>

<pre class = "s1">
The following functions have been added:
</pre>

<ul>
  <li>cubrid_pconnect</li>
  <li>cubrid_pconnect_with_url</li>
  <li>cubrid_set_query_timeout</li>
  <li>cubrid_get_query_timeout</li>
</ul>

<h4>Changed and Enhanced Features:</h4>

<pre class = "s1">
1.) Reuse the connection established:

    For mysql, if a second call is made to mysql_connect() with the same arguments, no new link will be established,
    but instead, the connect identifier of the already opened connection will be returned. The new_link parameter
    modifies this behavior and makes mysql_connect() always open a new connection, even if mysql_connect() was called
    before with the same parameters. 

    To make compatibility with mysql, we add the new_link parameter in cubrid_connect and cubrid_connect_with_url.

2.) Add persistent connection:

    We add two functions, cubrid_pconnect and cubrid_pconnect_with_url, to provide persistent database connections.
    The parameters of cubrid_pconnect are same with cubrid_connect, and so do cubrid_pconnect_with_url and
    cubrid_connect_with_url.

3.) Add functions about getting and setting the query timeout time:

    If database queries are taking too long to perform, and your application is becoming unresponsive, you can
    configure a timeout for database queries. We add two functions (cubrid_get_query_timeout and 
    cubrid_set_query_timeout) to get and set the query timeout of database queries.

4.) Add a form of the url parameter for cubrid_connect_with_url function:

    Support the way without "cci:" in url parameter, that is the url become "CUBRID:host:db_name:db_user:......."
 
</pre>

<h4>Fixed bugs:</h4> 

<pre class = "s1">
1.) Fix a bug in cubrid_fetch, cubrid_fetch_row, cubrid_fetch_array and cubrid_fetch_assoc: Modified the return value
when there are no more data;
